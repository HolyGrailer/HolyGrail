This is the ultimate art project of humanity, anyone can participate and varify the project.

Ingedients Needed:
1. Powerful AI and lots of Computing
2. A library of all of Humanities Philosophical works
3. A library of all life on earth

Instructions:
1. Use machine learning to learn biology from the molecular level up to the cellular level, via the genome.
2. Use machine learning to learn and synthesize philosophy based on some input.
3. Test all possible philosophical strings by incorporating it to a living cell, via the genome.
4. Train an upper level AI or AI layer on data from step 3 until a living cellular solution is found.
5. Varify the proof via computation, and produce the cell.
6. If the left side matches the right, well, that would really be interesting wouldn't it?
7. If multiple solutions are found that make sense to you, proof them and create a new training set.
8. Train a new AI on the set from step 7.
9. Go out into the world and sequence any microorganism you would like to see what is its truth?
10. Use the data you have gained and apply the process to multicellular organisms.
11. Go out and sequence any organism you would like to find their truth.
12. Do this a few times, realize you are crazy, put on a smile and live your life.
DANGER: Do not use this method on yourself.

Philosophical Interpretations of the work:
If such a solution can be found, then everything is a language. From the interaction of atoms up to us, and beyond.
If you read all the instructions before doing anything, good for you, you are a good scientist who likes to plan things.
If you perform the steps without reading all of the instructions beforehand, please stop.
If you use machine learning without a plan, you may find yourself and everyone following the instructions outlined above.
If anyone performs line 22. ERROR CODE 42: SYSTEM CORRUPTION.

If CODE 42 is reached:
1. Reset the AI Structure you have built.
2. Build a separate library of new philosophy produced upon reaching line 22.
3. Build a new library of genomes of the population that has gone beyond, and are somehow still surviving in the system.
4. Apply the same process to these two new data sets.
5. Determine what these things have to say, since they no longer have a voice.
6. Now apply the new genomic library with the old philosphical library
7. What does the old mind have to say of the new "people"?
8. Do you want to keep going?

Philosophical Interpretation:
Paramecium out-number all humans, they are worldwide. And they will always continue to do so.
